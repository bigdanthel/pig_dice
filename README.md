"Pig" is a popular dice game that is easy to learn and play. It's also known by various other names like "Pass the Pigs," "Pig Dice," or "Pig Out." The objective of the game is to be the first player to reach a certain score (usually 100 points) or any agreed-upon target score. Here are the game rules and how to play:

Number of Players: Two or more players can participate in the game. It works best with at least three players.

Equipment:

Two standard six-sided dice
A paper and pen to keep score
Gameplay:

The game is typically played in turns, with each player taking their turn one after the other, moving clockwise.

On your turn, you start by rolling both dice together.

After the roll, you earn points based on the results:

If you roll a 1 on either die, your turn ends immediately, and you score no points. This is referred to as "Pigging out," and your turn is passed to the next player.
If you roll a 1 on both dice, not only your turn ends, but you also lose all points you have accumulated in that round. Your total score goes back to what it was before the round began. This is often called "Double Pig Out" or "Piggybacking."
If you roll any other number combination (e.g., 2 and 4), you can choose to either:

Hold: Add the sum of the two dice to your current round's score and end your turn. The points you earned this round will be added to your total score later if you choose to hold.
Roll Again: Decide to roll the dice again to accumulate more points in the current round. You can keep rolling as long as you want, as long as you avoid rolling a 1 on either die.
The turn then passes to the next player, and they follow the same process.

Players continue taking turns, rolling, and accumulating points until one player reaches the agreed-upon target score (e.g., 100 points). That player is declared the winner.

Scoring:

Rolling a 1 on any die: 0 points (your turn ends)
Rolling a 1 on both dice: Lose all points accumulated in the current round (your turn ends)
Any other combination (e.g., 2 and 4): Add the sum of the two dice to your current round's score
Additional Notes:

Some variations of the game may introduce different scoring rules or add extra challenges, so be sure to clarify the specific rules before starting the game.
The game is often played for fun and can be enjoyed in social settings, family gatherings, or as a quick pastime. It involves both luck and strategy, as players must decide when to stop rolling to avoid losing their points.
To make it fair for players who go later in the turn order, it's common to set a rule that the game will continue until the end of the round after the first player reaches the target score. This way, everyone gets an equal number of turns.
